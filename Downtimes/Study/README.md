**__!downtime study__**

`!study` is used for the Arcane Study Downtime and use of it looks like: `!study <spell|tome|manual*> <hours>`

For example:

`!study quick 4` will study Manual of Quickness of Action for 4 hrs and create/adjust a counter of the same kind

*note: if it tries to train you in the wrong thing, it is a list that returns the first matching result so try typing its full name in `""` like:*

`!study "Manual of Quickness of Action" 4`*
